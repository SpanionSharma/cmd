        "error": "'peep' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n",
        "solution": "It looks like you've encountered a common typo! Let's break down why this happened and how to fix it.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Explanation\n\nThe error message `'peep' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file` means that the Windows command processor (CMD) couldn't find an executable file named `peep` (or `peep.exe`, `peep.bat`, etc.) in either your current directory (`C:\\Users\\Renesh\\Desktop\\cmd_assistant`) or any of the directories listed in your system's `PATH` environment variable.\n\nThis almost certainly happened because you intended to use **`pip`**, which is the standard package installer for Python. `peep` is a common typographical error when trying to type `pip`.\n\n### 2. Corrected Command\n\nThe command you likely intended to run is:\n\n```cmd\npip install\n```\n\n### 3. Extra Guidance\n\n1.  **Verify Python and pip Installation:**\n    Since `pip` is a tool for Python, ensure that Python is installed on your system, and that `pip` itself is correctly installed and accessible. You can check this by running:\n    ```cmd\n    python --version\n    pip --version\n    ```\n    If `python --version` shows a version number (e.g., `Python 3.9.7`), Python is installed. If `pip --version` also shows a version number, then `pip` is installed and accessible via your `PATH`.\n\n2.  **If `pip` is not found (even after correcting the typo):**\n    If `pip --version` gives a similar \"not recognized\" error, it means `pip`'s executable directory is not in your system's `PATH` environment variable.\n    *   **Reinstall Python:** The easiest way to fix this is often to reinstall Python, making sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\" during the installation process.\n    *   **Manually add to PATH:** Alternatively, you can manually add the `Scripts` directory of your Python installation (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\Scripts`) to your system's `PATH`.\n\n3.  **What `pip install` does:**\n    The `pip install` command is used to install Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other sources. You typically follow it with the name of the package you want to install, like `pip install requests` or `pip install numpy`.\n\nBy correcting the typo to `pip` and ensuring your Python environment is set up correctly, your command should now work as expected!",

        "solution": "The error you encountered indicates that `pip` could not find a package named `dhesh` in the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Explanation\n\nWhen you run `pip install <package_name>`, `pip` attempts to locate and download that package from PyPI, which is the official third-party software repository for Python.\n\nThe error message `ERROR: No matching distribution found for dhesh` means:\n*   **The package `dhesh` does not exist on PyPI under that exact name.** This is the most common reason for this error.\n*   It could be a typo in the package name.\n*   The package might be hosted on a different repository, or it might be a private or local package that `pip` isn't configured to find.\n\nIn this specific case, `dhesh` is not a known package on PyPI.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Corrected Command\n\nSince \"dhesh\" is not a recognized package, there isn't a direct \"corrected command\" for `dhesh` itself. Instead, you need to identify the *correct name* of the package you intended to install.\n\n**Please replace `[intended_package_name]` with the actual name of the Python library you wish to install.**\n\n**Example (if you meant to install `dash`):**\n```bash\npip install dash\n```\n\n**Example (if you meant to install `flask`):**\n```bash\npip install flask\n```\n\nIf you are unsure of the correct package name, please refer to the \"Extra Guidance\" section below.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Extra Guidance\n\n1.  **Verify the Package Name:**\n    *   **Check for typos:** Double-check the spelling of the package you intended to install.\n    *   **Consult official documentation:** The official documentation for any Python library will always provide the exact `pip install` command. This is the most reliable way to get the correct package name.\n    *   **Search PyPI:** Go to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) and use the search bar to find the package. This will show you the exact name it's listed under.\n\n2.  **Update `pip` (Recommended, but not the cause of this error):**\n    The notice in your error output (`A new release of pip is available: 25.1.1 -> 25.3`) suggests updating `pip`. While updating `pip` won't fix the \"package not found\" issue, it's good practice to keep it up-to-date to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.\n    ```bash\n    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip\n    ```\n    This command should be run *after* you've resolved the original package installation issue, or as a separate maintenance step.\n\n3.  **Local or Custom Packages:**\n    If `dhesh` is a custom package you or someone else created locally, you might need to install it differently (e.g., from a local path, a Git repository, or a private package index). If so, the `pip install` command would look different (e.g., `pip install ./path/to/dhesh` or `pip install git+https://github.com/user/dhesh.git`).",
